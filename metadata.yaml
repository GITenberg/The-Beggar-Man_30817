description: Get swept away by romance in this charming tale from esteemed author
  Ruby Ayres. Faith is a delicate and sensitive girl who has to work long hours under
  harsh conditions in a local factory to help her family make ends meet. After a particularly
  grueling shift, she faints on the sidewalk on the way home -- only to be rescued
  by an unusual but kind fellow. Will this chance meeting change the course of her
  life?
